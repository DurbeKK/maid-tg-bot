# Maid Telgram Bot
## _Managing house chores is not much of a pain anymore!_

A simple reminder bot that is aimed at helping roommates do house chores. The time zone is set to `Asia/Tashkent`, but this can be changed if you plan to launch your own instance of the bot. This bot can:

- Keep track of whose turn it is in each queue
- Send reminders to do the chore
- Manage the queue if someone doesn't have time to do the chore
- Do a couple more small things (like reacting to emojis and announcing the meal name)

## Installation

Change the variables in the `.env.example` file and rename the file to `.env`. Next, build an image using the Dockerfile and then run your bot. That's about it.

## Sticker Pack

The bot uses the [sticker pack](https://t.me/addstickers/kobayashisdragonmaid) created by [@sethdistro](https://t.me/sethdistro). This project just wouldn't be the same without the pack, so big thanks to the creator of the pack!
